In this experimental dataset, significant changes in expression for only a few specific genes(gene 2 and 7) was introduced, while keeping the expression levels of the other genes relatively stable across the files. Since normalization divides each gene's expression level by the total expression across all genes, the changes are distributed across all genes. However, because there are only 10 genes, the effect of normalizing a few differentially expressed genes is more noticeable on the other genes compared to datasets with thousands of genes. By selectively altering only a subset of genes, it has been ensured that not all genes appear differentially expressed after normalization, making it appear as though only the intended genes are affected while the others remain relatively unchanged.
